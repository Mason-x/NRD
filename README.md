# üõ°Ô∏è NRD Lists - Block Newly Registered Domains

Effortlessly block newly registered domains (NRDs) that are often used for malicious purposes, phishing, and tracking. The NRD lists are updated frequently and are compatible with a variety of DNS filtering and ad-blocking tools.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Informations

| **Type**        | **Information**
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **NRD 14/30**   | Complete lists contain all Domains! (Also DGA and Phish)                 |
| **DGA 14/30**   | Lists of newly algorithm registered Domains from Malware families only!  |
| **Phish 14/30** | Lists of Domain which look like brand imitating domains! (High FP rate!) |

All Lists are causing high system memory usage!
Please be adviced that some lists are splitted in parts because of their size!
